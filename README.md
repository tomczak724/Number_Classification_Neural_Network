A neural network designed to classify hand-written digits from the [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Full disclosure: the heavy lifting of this code is based on the instructional video series on neural networks from the YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown ([link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk))
