# Number Classification Neural Network

Below is the tale of my pioneering journey into the world of neural networks.
The goal of this project is to develop the code to create a deep-learning neural network designed to classify hand-written digits.
Although there are some great existing libraries with "ready-made" code for this problem (e.g. [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks_supervised.html), [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_classification)) my aim is to write everything *mostly* from scratch.
I also hope to do a good enough job documenting my workflow to serve as a learning tool for any interested readers.

Training and testing data are taken from the well-known and widely-utilized [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
