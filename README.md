# Number Classification Neural Network
Below is the tale of my pioneering journey into the world of neural networks. My goal is to develop the code to define a deep-learning neural network designed to classify hand-written digits. It will support a variety of user-defined parameters such as allowing arbitrary numbers of hidden layers containing arbitrary numbers of neurons each.

Furthermore, I hope to also develop an interactive element to this codebase wherein the user (that's you) will be able to "draw" numerals in a plotting window and have them classified in real time by a fully trained network; however, this may prove to be too ambitious (let's hope not).

Training and testing data are taken from the well-known and widely-utilized [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). I must also acknowledge the superb educational/instructional video series from Grant Sanderson's YouTube channel [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) which layed the foundation for this project.
